# Delayed-to-Rest
for guitar and computer
<br><br>

Running Time:<br>
7 minutes and 10 seconds<br><br>

Program Note:<br>
"Delayed to Rest" is a work for solo electric guitar and a computer running custom software written for this piece. As the guitarist performs, the computer takes the live sound of the guitar, heard through the center speaker, delays its output by a few beats, then plays it through the two side speakers. This produces and echoing effect. The performer uses a footswitch to tell the computer how many beats to delay the sound, and to control other delay-based processes. Every sound heard originates in real-time from what the guitarist performs live; nothing is prerecorded, sampled, or synthesized. Nothing that the computer does is random: it uses specific delay times, rhythms, and signal levels throughout the piece according to the score.

Technical Information:<br>
This piece is intended for a solo electric guitar player and computer with the use of a MIDI-mapable footswitch to control the computer processes. The guitar signal should run into the computer and be used with amp-simulation software (such as Bias, Guitar Rig, or another VST plugin) within the "Delayed to Rest" software. The software was also written by the composer and is available from vjmanzo.com.<br>
Separate stereo audio channels for the live guitar and the live computer sounds are provided within the software. This work is intended to be performed with a stereo amp or speaker behind the guitarist for the guitar sounds, and left and right speakers on both sides of the guitarist for the computer sounds. An option to perform from a single sound source is also available within the software. The software also includes a demo function that simulates an actual performance.
